        * Comments by his mentor, Yoshifumi SEKI:  
        "[He is wonderful at having clear motivation for research and being able to properly verbalize it. We smoothly brushed up our idea and made advances in our research because he always brings his own opinions in our discussion.](https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1245535084523872256)
        [I gave two pieces of advice, one of which was "don't jump to simple conclusions (hypotheses) too soon. By testing the hypothesis from various angles, coming up with your own counter-arguments, squashing those counter-arguments, and testing them in-depth, the hypothesis becomes better. If he acquires this kind of research process, his research ability would be more excellent.](https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1245536364323426305)
        [Going back to motivation can also refine the task itself and make the research more valuable by updating the motivation itself. If these processes are run by individuals even in part, it would be easier to improve the quality of research, which leads to more fruitful discussions with other researchers.](https://twitter.com/YoshifumiSeki/status/1245537553614159872)"
